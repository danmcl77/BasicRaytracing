# BasicRaytracing

This program can simulate a user-defined simple optical system in 2 dimensions and find the paths taken by any number of light-rays through said system. Guidelines on how to use found within the program.

I made this during college inspired by a lecture on raytracing in my Applied Optics module, wondering if the process of raytracing could be automated without using any programs or libraries outside of basic Python.
